   We present an algorithm enumerating all Lyndon subsequences in time and space linear to the output size.
In a subsequent evaluation, we benchmarked an implementation of our algorithm on all strings of fixed small lengths and alphabet sizes, and could draw a connection between the observed average number of Lyndon subsequences and the expected average number of Lyndon subsequences obtained by Hirakawa et al.
Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/borjaf696/LyndonEnumeration}.
