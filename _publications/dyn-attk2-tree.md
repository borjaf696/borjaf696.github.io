    In this paper, we propose a compact data structure to store labeled attributed graphs based on the $k^2$-tree, which is a very compact data structure designed to represent a simple directed graph. The idea we propose can be seen as an extension of the $k^2$-tree to support property graphs. In addition to the static approach, we also propose a dynamic version of the storage representation, which allows flexible schemas and insertion or deletion of data. We provide an implementation of a basic set of operations, which can be combined to form complex queries over these graphs with attributes. We evaluate the performance of our proposal with existing graph database systems and prove that our compact attributed graph representation obtains also competitive time results.
