New algorithm for full viral haplotype reconstruction and abundance estimation. It is an alternative approach for the first developed approach viaDBG which was based entirely on de Bruijn graphs. ViQUF is based on flow networks which allows us to do a proper and successful estimation of the strains frequencies.
