## About me

Passionate about technologies, mathematics, and an eternal student. My work experience is focused
on the academic field so far. Being my lines of study algorithms, mathematics (statistics and applied
mathematics), and the modeling and implementation of solutions based on artificial intelligence.
During the last five years, I have acquired a good amount of technical knowledge, especially in
programming (C, C++, R, and Python) and mathematical modeling. I consider myself particularly
curious, and always willing to learn.
